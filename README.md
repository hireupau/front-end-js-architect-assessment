# Front-end JS Architect Assessment

## Overview

[EJS](http://ejs.co/) (Embedded JavaScript templates) is a server and client-side templating language, which doesn't reinvent things. It's just plain JavaScript.

One of its downsides, however, is that it has no concept of "[partial/component composition](https://github.com/mde/ejs/issues/437)", [unlike Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/partials.html#partial-block), or React and Vue, for instance.

## Task

We'd like you to extend EJS to support partial template composition, with you determining the syntax for how this is achieved and used.

It provides us a chance to see your:

* Attention to understand and maintain an existing project development style.
* Clean architectural implementation demonstrating separation of concerns, encapsulation of IO, and testable methods.
* Your level of general JavaScript knowledge.

## Guidance on time spent

While you should be free to decide how much time you'd like to spend developing your solution, in the interests of not taking up all your time, we strongly advise to limit yourself to five hours or less. Feel free to document approaches you would have taken had time been ample.

## Submission

Please push your changes to a public GitHub repo and let us know when you're done. If you're confident in your solution, you can even submit it as a PR to the EJS project :)
